# Network Security Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing phishing data and building a machine learning-based solution to enhance network security. The repository contains tools and scripts for data preprocessing, model training, prediction generation, and deployment. The project is containerized using Docker and leverages AWS services for deployment and scalability.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Tools for cleaning, validating, and preparing network data for analysis.
- **Phishing Data Analysis:** Analytical scripts to detect patterns in phishing attempts.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Pre-trained and final models to classify and predict phishing activities.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Integrated logging for monitoring application performance and debugging.
- **Containerization:** Dockerized application for consistent deployment.
- **AWS Integration:** Deployment using AWS services, including AWS ECR for container registry.
